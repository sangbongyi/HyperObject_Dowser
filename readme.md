# Hyperobject Dowser

**_Stepper motor controller that rotate brass rods depends on the signal magnitude from WiFi devices and satellites on the sky. This code allows the esp32 board to scan the existence of WiFi routers, and the location of satellites that are tracked based on the current GPS position of the device. Then, it calculates the number of sources which emit signals and magnitudes of those signal from the sources. Lastly, the device converts the number of sources and magnitude of signals to the rotation value of the stepper motor for the dowsing rod._**

## Introduction

The device was inspired by an idea that derived from the speculation between the notion of hyperobject, humiliating artificial environments, and Lovecraftian monsters. This superstitious apparatus detects the presence of a hyperobject veiled behind in the air by using implicit information such as radio wave signals from Wifi and satellites.

People always try to find a way to identify an invisible thing that surrounds us. Like they did to nature. The more it feels terrifying and makes us humiliated, The more we strive to come up with tools to solve the problem. However, not all of the solutions were adequately made. One of the examples was dowsing Rod. Even in this modern time, people could stick to a thinking process based on fear and curiosity which is highly dependent on an irrational mind, just like the way people thought in the past.

## Interaction diagram
This apparatus considers data collection activity from the stacks of networks as a creepy gaze from the hyperobject in the form of electromagnetic pulses and represents its magnitude as a rotation of two brass rod. The more the device detects the density of artificial signals nearby, the stronger the gaze it represents. Thus, the device make the brass rod rotate further based on the magnitude of the signal.
